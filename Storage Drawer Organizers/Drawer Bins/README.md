## The smaller drawers in this particular toolbox/organizer are about 44mm wide.

A custom Gridfinity grid pattern with 44mm grid sizing is used to build 3x1 grid layouts in each drawer. There is a slight bit of space remaining (rounded, not square) after 3 x 44mm grid squares are filled depth-wise and thus a special bin is made to fil the remaining space.
